# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Purpose 
Pewlett-Hackard has approached us because they are about to have a big wave of employees ready to retire. We have performed an analysis to help them plan and prepare for this upcoming change within the company.

This analysis finds the number of retiring employees by job title within Pewlett-Hackard. It also finds the number of employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Results
- While sorting the data to find the number of employees who will be retiring soon, we first created a table of all employees who soon be turning retirement age. We did this by sorting out all current employees who were born between 1952 and 1955. This returned the list of retirement ready employees and all of their current and former job titles. This can be seen in the table below.

- To find the true number of employees who will be retiring, we used the unique feature to just get each employee's most recent job title. Then, we did a count of each title that has employees who will be retiring soon. The results of this table are below.

- It will be important for Pewlett-Hackard to note that they will have nearly 50,000 employees with a Senior job title about to retire. They may want to handle this by promoting some of their current staff to a Senior level job.

- A final result worth noting is that only 2 Managers are becoming retirement eligible. Pewlett-Hackard should look into why this and consider if this will be an important role to fill or not. 

## Summary

- In order to find the total number of employees who will be eligible for retirement, we totaled the number of employees retiring from each job title. This shows that there will be 72,458 employees eligible for retirement.

- It seems that there are enough retirement-ready employees in Pewlett-Hackard to mentor the next generation of employees. With 50,000 Senior level employees that are retirement-ready, Pewlett-Hackard can use them to train and mentor up and coming employees.
